CS 181R

i want you to feel like you are the inventor originator

What I cannot create, I do not understand

I will have mistakes in my first time teaching this
Let me know if something feels off

Using hypothesis

## Description

We will cover the fundamentals of mobile robotics including, cultural considerations, electronics, fabrication, kinematics, dynamics, control theory, motion planning, estimation, localization, and vision. Students will build and program a mobile robot to complete a series of tasks. Many of these subjects have broad applications in areas well beyond robotics (e.g., control theory is used in robotics, video games, economics, genomics, medicine, chemistry, etc.).

## Delivery Methods

I am going to deliver the course in a flipped-style. I am working on a course website that will act as an interactive textbook. It will include videos, interactive figures and equations, and check-your-understanding style pop-up questions. Here is a quick demo of a kinematics widget I recently created:

The general flow of the class will include follow the following routine:

1. Students will watch embedded lecture videos and read related material before class. I am going to use Hypothesis so that students can annotate the material with questions and comments.
2. Classes will start with a short quiz to remind students they must complete the pre-class work.
3. We will then have a brief discussion of the material.
4. Students will then work on a hands-on activity related to the material.

## Prerequisites

The following courses are required as prerequisites:

- Data structures (CS 62)
- Calculus II (MATH 31)

Exposure to the following subjects would be great, but is not required or expected:

- Linear algebra (MATH 60)
- Statistics (MATH 58)
- Vector calculus (MATH 67)
- Computer systems (CS 105)
- Algorithms (CS 140)
- General physics (PHYS 41)
- Mechanics (PHYS 125)

### Resources

Here are some optional background materials if you want to brushup on concepts or prepare yourself for a better appreciation of the topics in this course:

TODO: find for the following

- Statistics (MATH 58)
- Vector calculus (MATH 67)
- Computer systems (CS 105)
- Algorithms (CS 140)
- General physics (PHYS 41)
- Mechanics (PHYS 125)
